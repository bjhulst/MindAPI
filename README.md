## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://dsopas.github.io/MindAPI/)

I love mindmaps. They help keep my methodology when doing security research or brainstorming with my collegues. With that in mind I decided to spread some love in the community by creating MindAPI.

Nowadays APIs are part of all modern applications. Creating something that could help the security community to assess an API and at the same time help me by keeping my work organized its a win-win.

MindAPI is a mindmap which combines years of experience in testing API security. Its divided into two sections:

- Reconnaissance
- Testing (Follows OWASP API Security Top 10 guidelines and other security guides)

On both of them you have guidelines, links to open-source tools and documentation that help you on the way.

### Built With

* [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)
